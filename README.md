# Customer Management System

A coffee shop that tracks the orders for delivery that are received by phone calls. The coffee shop has several employees that are using the system:
1. Clerks: Set orders and can check if there are pending orders.
2. Delivery: Update an order as completed.
3. Manager: View reports and statistics.

Each employee has a user account to login (username/password) and the system will identify their role and respond accordingly.

On receiving an order, the clerk enters to the system:
• The ID of customer (if the customer is new, will add the customer: name, address, phone number)
• Description of the order
• Date
• Total amount of orders
Then, a clerk will be able to assign an order to a delivery employee.
The clerk will also be able to check incomplete orders.

Upon delivery, the delivery employee gets into the system and updates the order as completed.

The manager will be able to select from the system to do the following:
• Customer profile (demographic data, total number of orders, total amount paid).
• Number of orders in a specific day and total amount of orders.
• Pending orders.
• Total number of orders per clerk and total amount of these orders.
• Export data to CSV files.
